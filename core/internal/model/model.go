// This is what lets one small rule set find instances nobody enumerated: credentials
// in a log, internal detail in a response body, request data in a shell command, and
// PII in an outbound webhook are the same three-part judgement over different values.

	// be something more than one of the language's own containers.
	//
	// A frontend that cannot type its receivers leaves this unanswerable, and an
	// unanswered question does not satisfy the requirement — it costs confidence
	// instead (ADR-005), because a match this weak has not earned a gate. NO TYPE AT

	// data that arrived in the request, and `user.save()` never is.
	//
	// This asks the dataflow a question it has already answered. The receiver is a

	// A SQL statement is BUILT, so untrusted data composed into it is the defect. A

	//
	// The cost is a stated false negative. `"https://" + host` IS caller-chosen and is
